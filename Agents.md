Conversational agents and bots have been around for decades but it’s only recently that they have become hot again. They’re meant to help users achieve and/or complete a particular task. Bots can help users interact with a particular service or application without having to download a separate app or go to a specific Web site. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), internet of things (IoT), the cloud, bigdata and mobile aps all contribute to the need for interfaces which need to be flexible yet precise (i.e. presenting the correct info you requested). Enter chat UX.

There are tons of restaurant apps for mobile, there are tons of apps for pretty much anything these days. So, which one should you install? Actually, no one is interested in the app itself, you usually simply want an answer to your question. What is the value of my shares today? Where is the nearest train station? How many calories in a cup of tea? The confluence of data and devices makes us more and more dependent on getting an answer, independently of where it comes from or the app. So, instead of trying to make applications which map all possible things we need and collecting heaps of notes, appointments and whatnot the world slowly turns towards intelligent agents which take over the tedious parts. Instead of you having to install an app, register yet another account, looking up the data…the agents figure it all out. Even better, they take into account your preferences, location, history and more. Bots and agents can replace convoluted interfaces and the many small apps we carry around.

Intelligent agents increasingly replace traditional UI within specific domains. Domotics for instance where one can create a well-defined boundary of commands related to your household. Agents don’t have to answer any and every question, just the ones they are supposed to deal with. So, one should not consider the current trend of bots toward the ultimate sci-fi oracle, indistinguishable from a human being, but rather a trend towards simplifying human-machine interactions (better: human-data interactions).

Qwiery can be useful if you wish to explore ways to create domain-specific agents. This is also known as [Artificial Narrow Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_AI). It also shows that there are many ways one can fake intelligent behavior. What is most unique about Qwiery is probably the interaction between graphs and language.
