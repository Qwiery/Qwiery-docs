###What is Qwiery?

Qwiery is a platform with natural language services for applications, services, bots and devices. It's a service which can be

- branded with business-specific or domain-specific data,
- integrated into web, mobile and desktop applications,
- connected to external data sources and services to resolve questions
- extended with custom answers, custom processing and modules.

The services can be consumed independently or combined into a processing pipeline. You can use Qwiery for standard sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging or keyword extraction from text, tweets and documents. You can, however, do much more and combine

- an emotions-engine
- a personalization backend
- a semantic (knowledge) network
- an inference engine

into a natural language pipeline to emulate a chat interface, domotic middleware, a marketing optimization system based on social network data or any system which requires language understanding.
