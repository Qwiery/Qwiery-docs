# Qwiery-Documentation

This is the documentation of Qwiery and the various services of Qwiery.

These documents [are available online](http://dashboard.qwiery.com/Dashboard/documentation) and complement [the API documention](http://dashboard.qwiery.com/dashboard/apidocs/).
Note that the Swagger-based documentation of the API allows you to test the services interactively.

The documents are available via [the Babble interface](http://babble.qwiery.com) too. Simply use the `help:` command for a specific topic. For example, `help: qwiery` will return the `WhatIsQwiery.md` document from this repo. Babble uses the `metadata.json` file for lookups and topic synonyms. You can manage what Babble will return by augmenting that file with keywords and links.


For info and everything, please [contact us](http://www.qwiery.com/contact) or see the [Orbifold Consulting](http://www.orbifold.net/contact) website for additional contact information.

Thank you for using Qwiery!
