## Babble



The information below applies to the Babble application and reflects to some extend the Qwiery platform. The Babble application is an HTML/JavaScript single-page app which makes use of the Qwiery platform. It demonstrates a whole lot of features and things you can do with Qwiery.

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Intro


You can ask Qwiery anything you like but there are also specific commands which instruct Qwiery to handle a question in a particular way. Below is a summary of these commands. There are in general **multiple ways to get the same result** and Qwiery knows quite a bit about synonyms and equivalent formulations, so the list below is not exhaustive but rather some guidelines.

The user interface is **text and command based**. This means that all of the many types of information available are not accessed via a classsic set of buttons and widgets but only via text input. Whether you want to log in, manage user permissions or see a pie chart of Qwiery's emotional state, all of this goes via natural language or some keywords.

Qwiery has also **a server-side language**, the Qwiery Template Language or QTL, which defines how Qwiery thinks and handles requests. [More information about QTL can be found here.](http://www.qwiery.com/overview/qwiery-template-language/)

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Login and logout

Qwiery uses Twitter, Google or Facebook for authentication, you can pick one or all of them to login. Simply use the `login` command to get started:

> [login](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=login)

If you are already logged in this will show your existing account as well as the API key with which you access Qwiery:

![Login.png](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Login.png)

To log out you can use `log out` or `logoff`:

> [logout](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=logout)


---

###  ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Sentiment analysis 
This identifies and categorizes opinions expressed in a piece of text, it can be triggered explicitly by means of the `sentiment` command:

> [sentiment: I feel awesome today](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=sentiment:%20I%20feel%20awesome%20today)
> That's quite a positive statement [score: 1.1].

Qwiery performs sentiment analysis on any input and uses it internally but this command allows you to see the results of this analysis. The input can also be a URL:

> [sentiment: http://www.bbc.co.uk](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=sentiment:http://bbc.co.uk)
> That's a neutral statement [score: 0].

---

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) English grammatics, dictionary and thesaurus
You can lookup words using the `define` or `lookup` command:

> [define: deipnosophist](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=define:%20deipnosophist)
> Found the following for 'deipnosophist': someone skilled at informal chitchat.

Synonyms can be asked in a similar fashion:

> [synonyms: delight](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=synonyms:%20delight)
> enchant, enrapture, transport, enthrall, ravish

If you would like some inspiration, you can ask Qwiery to produce random (but real) English words:

> [random words](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=random%20words)
> aphid, hahn, ozone sickness, edronax, multiplexer, razzmatazz, joyce carol oates, adulterate, padre, giddily

Part of speech (POS) analysis will return the grammatical structure of the given input:

> [pos: You can type anything here to analyze its grammatical structure.](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=pos:%20You%20can%20type%20anything%20here%20to%20analyze%20its%20grammatical%20structure.)

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Maths and conversions

Qwiery understands some maths and will try to resolve anything you throw at it. For example, using the `plot` command with a function definition will result in:

> [plot Gamma(x)](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=plot%20Gamma(x))

![GammaPlot.png](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GammaPlot.png)

Note that there is (see below) another plot command `plot:` with a semi-column which uses a different type processing (one based on the R statistics package).

Standard calculations will return the result:

> [2.3*8/7.01/log(88/7)](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=2.3*8/7.01/Math.log(88/7))
> 1.0368942222037716

There are also various more intelligent mathematical operations possible like

> [10 inch to cm](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=10%20inch%20to%20cm)
> 25.4 cm

> [1.7 liter to gallon](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=1.7%20liter%20to%20gallon)
> 0.45 gallon

---

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Entity creation

Entities (ideas, tasks, appointments...) can be added explicitly to Qwiery by means of the `add` command like so

> [add: apple cake](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=add:%20apple%20cake)
> The newly created idea is shown in read-mode.

> [add task: pickup the kids tonight](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=add%20task:%20pickup%20the%20kids%20tonight)
> I have added this to your tasks.

Entities are automatically deduced from conversations and stored in the semantic network. They are used as knowledge and inference.

![Add Idea](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/AddIdea.png)
---

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Notebooks

Newly created entities are stored in the active notebook and if you wish to change the current notebook you can do so via the `set:space:` command:

> [set:space: default](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=set:space:default)
> The workspace entitled 'default' is now your active space.

At any moment only one notebook is active. Note that you don't need to specify the full name of the notebook, only an identifying portion is sufficient. In the example above the full name is in fact 'Default workspace'.

To see the list of notebooks use

> [notebooks:](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=notebooks:) or [spaces](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=spaces)


![Spaces](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Spaces.png)

Notebooks collect entities in the semantic network and can be seen as either a security boundary or a semantic boundary or both. Notebooks can be shared with other users and made public.

Use the `add:space:` command to add and activate a new notebook:

> [add:space:genetics](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=add:space:genetics)
> The new space was added and is now the active one. You can change the active workspace by using the command 'set:space:genetics'.


---
 

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Inline help
the documentation of topic and commands can be obtained via the `help` command:

> [help:login](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=help:login)
> You can simply type 'login' or 'account'.
> If you wish to log out use 'logout'.

---

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Search

you can tell Qwiery to search things explicitly by means of the `search` command:

> [search: Peking](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=search:peking)
> _results from Google, Bing and so on_

If you rather use a specific service like Wolfram Alpha you can use

> [search: alpha: coffee](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=search:alpha:coffee)
> serving size 1 cup (240 g) total calories 2 | fat calories 1 % daily value^* | total fat 228 mg | 0% saturated fat 113 mg | 1% trans fat 0 g | cholesterol 0 g | 0% sodium 19 mg | 1% total carbohydrates 0 g | 0% dietary fiber 0 g | 0% sugar 0 g | protein 264 mg | 1% iron 1% | thiamin 1% riboflavin 15% | niacin 32% folate 1% | phosphorus 1% magnesium 25% | zinc 1% *percent daily values are based on a 2000 calorie diet (averaged over different types of coffee)

Note that search results can be easily saved as semantic entities in your own personal graph by means of the plus-sign next to the search results.

To search your notebooks (aka graph) you can use

> [search: graph: j*](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=search:graph:j*)
> _displays a table with results_

Searching for images can go like this

> [images of manifold learning](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=images%20of%20manifold%20learning)
> _images are displayed_

or using the `search:pics:` (you can also use `search:images:` or `search:pictures:`

> [search: pics: coffee grinder](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=search:pics:coffee%20grinder)
> _images are displayed_

To search the news you can use similar constructs:

> [search:news: MacBook](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=search:news:macbook)
> _news items are displayed_

or simply something like

> [news about the new MacBook](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=news%20about%20the%20new%20macbook)
> _news items are displayed_

![Images Of](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ImagesOf.png)

---

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Tags

tags are labels you can attach to entities which help to organize your info. Some tags are automatically created and you can see all your tags by means of the `get:tags:` command:

> [get: tags:](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=get:tags:) or simply [tags:](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=tags:)
> _a clickable list of tags is displayed_

You can add a tag by means of

> [add:tag: MyNewTag](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=add:tag:MyNewTag)
> The tag has been added.


![DragDrop](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DragDropTag.png)

At any time you can access a mosaic of your stuff via various commands, e.g. `ideas` will display something like the following

![Show My Stuff](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ShowMyStuff.png)

You click the elements in the mosaic and you will get an editor for the specific type (i.e. the editor depends on whether you display a person, an idea etc.):

![Idea Reader](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IdeaReader.png)

Independently of the element being edited, you have some common elements:

- you can add the entity to your favorites by clicking on the star0cion
- delete it 
- edit it via the icon in the upper-right corner
- the "Related" section is droppable area where you can dragdrop other entities to create relations, drop image which will be uploaded and linked to the current entity and so on. To remove a related item you can simply click on the remove-icon which appears upon hovering over the links.

To delete a tag you can use

> [delete: tag: music](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=delete:tag:music) or [delete tag: music](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=delete%20tag:music)
> _you will need to confirm the deletion and so on_

Finally, if you want to see all concepts (aka entities) with a specific tag just enter

> [get:tag:music](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=get:tag:music)
> _a mosaic with entities is displayed_

The various commands related to tags examplify the general pattern, you can use similar command for tasks, appointments and so on:

- `get:` followed by a type will fetch data
- `delete:` followed by a type removes data
- `add:` followed by a type adds data

Updating things is possible after you have fetched a particular type. 

The `favorites' tag is a special tag which gets attached to an entity when you click on the star-icon (see above). If you use the `favorites` command you get a mosaic of your ideas, tasks and so on which you marked as favorite:

![Favorites](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Favorites.png)

---

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Client-specific commands

The default web-client of Qwiery is a dynamic interface which can be manipulated with commands as well. Note that these commands have no meaning or effect if you use Qwiery in your own integrations, they are purely client-side JavaScript handlers.


> [show all](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=show%20all)
> _displays all components in the interface_


> [hide all](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=hide%20all)
> _hides all components in the interface_

> [clear](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=clear)
> _clears the interface_

The individual components can be all shown or hidden in a similar fashion

> [show trail](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=show%20trail)
> _shows the trail component_

> [hide trail](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=hide%20trail)
> _hides the trail component_

You can provide feedback about Qwiery or the answers via the `feedback` command:

> [feedback](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway?q=feedback)

---

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Admin and management

If you have an admin role you can access various dashboards and use commands which alter the behavior of Qwiery.

> [admin: users](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=admin:users)
> _displays the user management dashboard_

> [admin: usage](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=admin:usage)
> _displays statistics and such_

---

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Send mail (aka workflows)

Workflows are a powerful concept in Qwiery. They capture a series of question and answers around a particular topic. You can notice that you are inside a workflow if Qwiery insists on returning an answer regarding something. For example, Qwiery can insist that you answer with yes-like (yes, OK, sure, duh...) or no-like (nope, nah, nada...) before moving on.

The 'send mail' is a workflow which captures the info necessary to send a mail:

> [send mail](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=send%20mail)
> _a series of question-answers_

If a workflow is interrupted it can be saved or discarded. If you opt to save the flow it will appear as a task in your task list (which you can access using `tasks`) and Qwiery also reminds you of it now-and-then. 
This reminder mechanism is configurable and has a random component as well.

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) History

Qwiery remembers what you said and uses various algorithms on your history. You can see your recent input via the trail component in the interface (if not visible use `show trail`) or the whole history via

> [history](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=history)

![History](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/History.png)

This history can also be accessed via the badge number (the number left of the current input) or by clicking on your avatar. The history is part of a bigger set of user data which you see via the `profile` command.

---

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Profile

All of your data is accessible to you and can be altered or deleted. You own the data. To access everything Qwiery knows about you simply type `profile` or click on your avatar:

> [profile](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=profile)
 
 ![Profile](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Profile.png)
---

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Ask an agent

Qwiery hosts multiple agents and by default you will be answered by the default bot. If you wish to ask e.g. the cooking bot `Chef` about vanilla crean you can do so using the Twitter-like tag:

> [@chef vanilla cream](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=@chef%20vanilla%20cream)
> _Chef's answer about vanilla ice cream or similar_

Chef's answers are based on the [Seasoned Advice](http://cooking.stackexchange.com) data. Qwiery uses various data sources and an offline copy of some [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com) networks are accessible to Qwiery. 

If you ask @Einstein the physics agent about water evaporation you get an answer from the [physics stack](http://physics.stackexchange.com):

> [@Einstein Why can water evaportate?]()
> The molecules on the surface have a random amount of kinetic energy E with a probability proportional to > > exp(−E/kT), i.e. the Boltzmann distribution. It follows that occasionally (albeit rarely) a molecule will > have a large enough kinetic energy E to break away from the surface and evaporate.
> That's the kinetic explanation. From a thermodynamic point of view, evaporation increases the entropy of > > the universe. And so the second law of thermodynamics drives evaporation until the air is sufficiently > humid that equilibrium is achieved and the free energy is minimised.

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Website summary

you can ask Qwiery to fetch the summary of a website like so

> [summary: http://www.qwiery.com](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=summary:%20http://www.qwiery.com)
> _a summary of the site is displayed_

---

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Keywords and tagging

you can ask Qwiery about the most important keywords in a website

> [keywords: http://www.cnbc.com](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=keywords:%20http://www.cnbc.com)
> world (7%)
> news (7%)
> middle (7%)
> market (7%)
> latin (7%)

---

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Rich data presentation

Various questions engender some data visualization like this one:

> [What is the GDP of India?](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=What is the GDP of India?)

![Line Chart](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/LineChart.png)

There is also a link to the R statistical package which makes it possible to plot given data or use R-functions. For example, the following plots the 100 random values taken from a Poisson distribution (lambda=3):

> [plot:rpois(100,3)](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=plot:rpois(100,3))

![RPlot](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/RPlot.png)

Video, images and sound are presented if possible. If you provide e.g. a YouTube URL it will be automatically tagged with the 'Video' and 'YouTube' tags and an entity will be created in your current notebook. 

> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAWyex1GKRU](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAWyex1GKRU)

If you request a video entity you will see for instance the video embedded in Qwiery:

![Video](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Video.png)

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Time, agenda and appointments

Qwiery tries hard to make sense of dates and time in your input. The standard question will be answered:

> [What date is today?](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=What%20date%20is%20today?)
> It's Sunday, July 3rd 2016.

>[Time](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=time)
> Time is the essence of life. In case you wish to know the time right now, it's 11:36 AM here.

Every user has an agenda which Qwiery uses to keep track of appointments and events:

> [Next Wednesday](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=Next%20Wednesday)
> Next Wednesday will be March 21st, 2016. No appointments in your agenda right now on that date. Should I book something?

Appointments are automatically recorded within the accuracy given:

> [I need to go to Wimbledon next month.](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=I need to go to Wimbledon next month)
> A new appointment was added on the 1st of November. Do you wish to specify another date?

If you are more specific you will get this:

> [I need to go to Wimbledon next month on the 23rd.](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=I need to go to Wimbledon next month on the 23rd)
> A new appointment was added on the 23rd of November. Do you wish to specify a specific time?

and so on. You agenda is, like all of your data, accessible via your profile or via the `agenda` command:

> [agenda](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=agenda)

![Agenda](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Agenda.png)

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) How does Qwiery feel (about you)?

Qwiery has an emotional module which affects the way it responds. The emotions are triggered by the aims it has (which are defined through a personality profile) and you can ask how it feels:

> [How do you feel?](http://www.qwiery.com/gateway/?q=How%20do%20you%20feel)

The aims shown in the second part are based on a predefined personality of the underlyind agent. The default agent (@qwiery or @default) has a Da Vinci personality which combines preferences for science and art topics. This means that topics like sports or entertainment have a negative effect on Qwiery's emotions while maths, science and art have a positive impact.

### ![Qwiery](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/QwieryIcon16.png) Feedback

You can provide feedback about Qwiery or the answers returned via the 'feedback' link in the bottom-right of each answer-box:

![Feedback](http://www.qwiery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Feedback.png)

You can also use the `feedback` command in the input-box:
